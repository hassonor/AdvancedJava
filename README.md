# Advanced Java Exercises

This repository contains practice materials and code examples for advanced Java topics. It is organized into two main modules: **DataStructuresReview** and **JavaHTPE11**. The exercises range from basic data structure implementations to concurrency and generic programming examples.

## Project Structure

- `DataStructuresReview/` – Java implementations used to revisit common data structures and algorithms.
- `JavaHTPE11/` – solutions and demos from the "Java: How to Program, 11th Edition" curriculum, covering topics such as generics, lambdas and concurrency.

## Requirements

- JDK 17 or later is recommended.
- You may build sources using `javac` directly or open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA.

## Running Examples

To compile and run individual examples:

```bash
javac path/to/File.java
java package.File
```

Alternatively, load the repository as a project in IntelliJ and run the desired class or test.

## License

This project is released under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues. Running the provided test classes with `javac` and `java` (or via your IDE) helps ensure examples continue to work.
